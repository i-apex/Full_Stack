TypeScript = JavaScript + Type Schecking + More Features + Code Completion + 

tsc : TypeScript compiler

launch.json : the file that will help in debugging - configuration for helping vscode in debugging the application
tasks.json : needed to specify the tasks for prelaunch in the launch.json
