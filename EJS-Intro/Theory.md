EJS - Embedded Java Script
It is used to seperate the front end with the logic
let's say using form we take input then when we click submit then 
via post method we get the value and then pass it back to the site using res.send method

abv is done using templating
 

 seperation of concerns: 
    seperating the frontend from backend

ejs helps in using the js code in a non-static format

can also be acheived by res.render method as it is non-static while res.send is used for static
files

It is a simple templating language/engine that lets its user generate HTML with plain javascript.

The app. listen() function is used to bind and listen to the connections on the specified host and port. This method is identical to Node's http. Server.


Never miss app.listenðŸ¥²

So basically, using inlinne js workd sometimes in sites to make them real-time reactive using ejsðŸ™ƒ
