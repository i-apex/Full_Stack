react makes a component/entity of all elements : html,css,js into one

Renderfunction of react same as js 
 .reactdomrender(What to show, where to show, callback)

react worls bycreating jsx files 
babel is a js compiler which reades

statements can't be written within render and only expressions can be rendered 
JSX: JavaScript XML

to let know the system that html like contentis allowed in index.js, the type is set to JSX
the "className" is specified to avoid errors
contentEditable - allows to edit by the user
to use properties into js object in an jsx file, camel casing is to be used

react components help in managing the code efficiently

to export any js object of a js file, we just need to export it and then it can  be used in any file
the order of exporting need not be the same as specified as long as the names are matching

React properties are used to create custom attributes for custom objects to increase readability
pre-defined attributes wouldn't work in the custom components as they willl be viewed as  custom attributes rather than an exisiting one

mapping of functional(a functional style of programming) helps in creating various objects of same type from an predefined array by by looping through it

react needs an unique property for every element that is being rendered to keep track and thus a unique key is provided

JS Functions:
Map -Create a new array by doing something with each item in an array.
Filter - Create a new array by keeping the items that return true.
Reduce - Accumulate a value by doing something to each item in an array.
Find - find the first item that matches from an array.
FindIndex - find the index of the first item that matches.

ternary operator helps in making a statement into expression so that can be used in the div element
&& operator shorts whenever the first condition is false and thus is useful

while using imperative style of programming in js it is difficult to show the changes made in one go as the html element needs to be re-rendered so hooks are used : useState Hook which offers the same functionality as a state change,i.e., declarative style of programming 

a hook must be used in a functional component

destructuring an array: mapping the corressponding elements to a particular variable

useState Hook contains an initialization which gets passed on to a variable which is updated by an function

destructuring arrays can be done with any name of variables but for objects it has to be done woith the same name as the predefined one
along with these the properties can also be assigned an default value

controlled components : keeping a single source of truth

react uses the event as a synthetic event and thus it should be never used in the setter functions(Hook)

spread operator helps in directly spreading an object inside any other structure instead of nesting it
